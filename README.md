# Wordle Game (C++)

This is a console-based Wordle-style game developed in C++ during my freshman year at Morehouse College. The project was created to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts such as control flow, string manipulation, and user interaction.

## 🎯 Features
- Fixed target word: **"SANTA"**
- Input validation to ensure only 5-letter guesses are accepted
- Color-coded letter feedback using ANSI escape codes:
  - 🟩 Green – Correct letter in the correct position
  - 🟨 Yellow – Correct letter in the wrong position
  - 🟥 Red – Incorrect letter
- Personalized messages for correct guesses and game completion

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Language: **C++**
- Concepts: Loops, conditionals, string functions, and user input handling
- Environment: Compiled and executed using a standard C++ compiler with terminal output support

## 🚀 How I Run the Game
The game is compiled and executed using a C++ compiler. I run the code directly through my development environment, which builds and launches the program in the terminal with a single click of the **Run** button.

## 💡 What I Gained
- Improved confidence writing clean and readable C++ code
- Hands-on experience with terminal-based UI through colored text
- Deeper understanding of game loops, conditional logic, and user feedback design
